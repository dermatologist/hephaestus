## About

Efficient and effective health data warehousing and analysis require a common data model. 

The [OHDSI - OMOP Common Data Model](https://www.ohdsi.org/) allows for the systematic analysis of disparate observational databases and EMRs. The data from disparate systems needs to be extracted, transformed and loaded on to a CDM database. Once a database has been converted to the OMOP CDM, evidence can be generated using standardized analytics tools.

Each data source requires customized ETL tools for this conversion. :stars: Hephestus is a tool for this ETL process organized into modules to allow code reuse between various ETL tools for open-source EMR systems and data sources. :stars: Hephestus uses [*SqlAlchemy*](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/) for database connection and automapping tables to classes and [*bonobo*](https://www.bonobo-project.org/) for managing ETL. Hephaestus also aims to support common machine learning workflows such as model building with Apache spark.
